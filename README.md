# Getting Started with IO Console

This proyect was created by David Fallas Val, for comments reach at [devFallas.io@gmail.com]


## NPN Calculator

This proyect was intended to do a simulation of a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator.

Main pourpose was to abstract the input read,  calculation and output write so that we may have different interfaces to provide the input of for the calculations and we cann write out in different interfaces.

For this sepecific case 1 component and 1 react hook were created. Given tha fact that there is plentty of ways we can approach this excersise I dicided to include React and MUI libraries just to have a wrasp on how will this frameworks behave to implement such exercise.
